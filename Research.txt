--I spent this past Friday researching my backend stretch goals and weighing how realistic it was to getting this done, 
 these are some of the resources I was reading/watching on friday, despite my interest in learning python i think for now
the safer route for my capstone is to keep my backend as simple as possible(and in c#) and focus on front end stretch goals. 
The plan moving forward is to just create a manually seeded database, im still unsure if its going to be SQL or noSQL
